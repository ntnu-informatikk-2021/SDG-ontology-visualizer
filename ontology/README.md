# SDG Ontology

The SDG_Ontology.owl file represents the ontology visualised. During inital development the main development of the ontology is done localy, where the updated ontology is sent to GraphDB. 

## Inital development
Further development on the ontology will be possible for only a set amount of superusers. This would be implementing new classes, object properties, data properties, annotations, along with limitations conserning implementing induviduals.  Only within certain subclasses of the class `Approaches`, will there be possiblites to implement induviduals.  For an inital prototype, the subclass of `Approaches`: `Luftkvalitet` will be avaliable for a frontend user to insert new induviduals. Furthermore, implemented object properties, data properties and annotations can be exploted during implementation of new induviduals to reuse the dynamic relations within the ontology.
